# FoodDelivery.github.io

I developed a food delivery application using Java that includes a signup and login system, a list of restaurants with menus, and features like checkout, payment, and order confirmation. The application securely stores all user information and their activity logs in a database, ensuring a smooth and personalized user experience.
